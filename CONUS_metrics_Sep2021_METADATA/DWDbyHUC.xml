The values are based on 2010 water demand and 2010 population distribution, and have been summarized by subwatershed, or 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC12). For the purposes of this metric, domestic water use includes residential uses, such as for drinking, bathing, cleaning, landscaping, and pools. Depending on the location, domestic water can be self-supplied, such as by private wells, or publicly-supplied, such as by municipalities. Sources include surface water and groundwater. Estimates are for primary residences only (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas.  EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract><purpose>This EnviroAtlas dataset could be used in conjunction with other EnviroAtlas data, such as Water Supply from Reservoirs and Industrial Water Use, to identify potential imbalances and trends between supply and demand. In areas with significant imbalances or detrimental trends, measures to further understand and alleviate pressure on the water supply could be implemented. In subsequent updates to EnviroAtlas, future demand scenarios will be incorporated based on projected population increases. The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose><supplinf>Reporting complexities exist within these data. For example, in the water use data, coefficients are derived based on available data, such as from public suppliers, and provide estimates for areas in which there might be less data available, such as self-supplied well withdrawals. People routinely cross reporting boundaries for activities, such as for work or vacation. In addition to these data complexities, another limitation in estimating water use is the inherent nature of water withdrawals and delivery. Self-supplied withdrawals (e.g., private wells) are calculated in the county in which the withdrawals occur. Publicly-supplied deliveries (e.g., from a municipality) may cross county, even multiple county or municipal, borders. For example, surrounding or upstream counties may supply urban counties, such as New York, NY, or Washington, DC, that have limited access to local natural resources. Considerable effort and diligence have been taken by the US Geological Survey (USGS) in standardizing, acquiring, estimating, and reporting the most accurate available data. There are also complexities associated with the dasymetric data. For example, the distribution is based on a combination of the US Census data and remotely sensed land cover at a 30m resolution. These data, however, represent the best available data at this time.</supplinf></descript><timeperd><current>Publication date</current><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>2010 (USGS Water Use), 2014 (Dasymetric,EPA-2010 US Census, Oct 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD)), 2015 (NHD Plus v2 WBD Snapshot, EnviroAtlas version - Conterminous US)</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo></timeperd><spdom><bounding><westbc>-128.02839229</westbc><eastbc>-65.20336449</eastbc><northbc>51.6773602</northbc><southbc>22.7348894</southbc></bounding></spdom><secinfo><secsys>https://project-open-data.github.io/schema/#accessLevel</secsys><secclass>public</secclass><sechandl>Standard Technical Controls</sechandl></secinfo><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development-Sustainable and Healthy Communities Research Program, EnviroAtlas</cntorg><cntper>EnviroAtlas Coordinator</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Geospatial Data Owner</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>109 T.W.

Low estimates were normalized using the US median and standard deviation. The finalized water use per person was weighted according to the estimated population per 30 meter pixel on the ground. The weighted water use was then summarized by subwatershed or 12-digit HUC.

More specifically, the initial data used to provide this metric is from the USGS. The USGS estimates a variety of water use data at 5-year intervals through the National Water Use Information Program (NWUIP). Data is collected at the state level by USGS water-use study chiefs and estimates are provided at the county level. Compilation methods vary slightly by state, depending on available data. Coefficients are derived and applied as needed to account for gaps in data. Overall guidelines used by the water-use study chiefs and the original data are available through the NWUIP website. 

In 2010, the USGS reported per capita (person) estimates for domestic (residential) water use, including publicly-supplied (e.g., municipalities) versus self-supplied (e.g., private wells) and associated population estimates. Due to limitations in estimating the distribution of these populations within the county, a weighted average per county was calculated, ((PS-TOPop*1000*DO-PSPCp)+(DO-SSPop*1000*DO-SSPCp)) / (TP-TotPop*1000) where a) PS-TOPop is the Publicly-Supplied Population (in thousands), b) DO-PSPCp is the Publicly-Supplied Per Capita Domestic use (in gallons per day per person), c) DO-SSPop is the Self-Supplied Population (in thousands), d) DO-SSPCp is the Self-Supplied Per Capita Domestic use (in gallons per day per person), e) TP-TotPop is the Total Population per county (in thousands), and f) 1,000 converts each population estimate from thousands to individuals.

Due to reporting complexities, such as the need for coefficients and the fact that people routinely cross reporting boundaries, estimates sometimes lead to outlying county results of gallons of water per day per person. To reduce the impact of outliers in the county data, the US median of 80 GPD and standard deviation of 38 GPD were used to normalize the 29 counties with &lt;42 GPD (as low as 16 GPD) to 42 GPD (-1 standard deviation). The high end estimate of 592 GPD was verifiable and, therefore, high end estimates were not adjusted.

The finalized GPDs were then weighted according to population distribution. The distributed population map is known as dasymetric population data. The dasymetric data were derived at the EPA using the 2011 NLCD and 2010 US Census data. To represent these results in the EnviroAtlas, the water use values were then summarized by subwatershed, or 12-digit HUC (2015 NHDPlus V2 WBD Snapshot, EnviroAtlas version - Conterminous US).</eaover><eadetcit>https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets</eadetcit></overview></eainfo><spref><horizsys><planar><planci><plance>coordinate pair</plance><plandu>meters</plandu><coordrep><absres>0.000001</absres><ordres>0.000001</ordres></coordrep></planci><mapproj><mapprojn>Albers Conical Equal Area</mapprojn><albers><stdparll>29.500000</stdparll><stdparll>45.500000</stdparll><longcm>-96.000000</longcm><latprjo>23.000000</latprjo><feast>0.000000</feast><fnorth>0.000000</fnorth></albers></mapproj></planar><geodetic><horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn><ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips><semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis><denflat>298.257222</denflat></geodetic></horizsys></spref></metadata>
