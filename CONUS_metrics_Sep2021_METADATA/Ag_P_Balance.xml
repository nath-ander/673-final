			<abstract>This EnviroAtlas national map displays the mean phosphorus (P) balance between inorganic fertilizer and confined manure inputs and P crop removal on croplands in the conterminous United States (excluding Hawaii and Alaska) for the year 2012 by 12-digit HUC. These data are based on International Plant Nutrition Institute compilations of county-level fertilizer sales data, confined manure production, and major crop harvest and P content of these crops, as well as the cropland area from the USGS's U.S. conterminous wall-to-wall anthropogenic land use trends (NWALT) 2012 land cover data.

			This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract>
			<purpose>The map, Agricultural Phosphorus Balance, is one of four EnviroAtlas maps that display P inputs and agricultural crop P demand for the conterminous US. These data could be used either alone or in conjunction with other data layers to help identify areas where P is a significant pollution source (over application) or where there are opportunities for more efficient management or recycling to meet crop demands. These data could also be used in models that examine the transport and cycling of P across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Information on crop P demand and uptake is, or will be, needed for the development of nutrient reduction strategies, nutrient credit exchanges, and payments for ecosystem services.

			Phosphorus (P) is an essential element of all living organisms, as a component of critical biomolecules for genetic material (DNA, RNA), energy transport (ATP) and membranes (phospholipids) within cells. As such it is necessary for plant growth along with nitrogen and other nutrients. In many ecosystems, including agricultural systems, P can limit plant growth and thus food production. In response to such limitations farmers may apply additional P in the form of inorganic fertilizers, food and green waste composts, animal manures, or biosolids from human waste, which all contain P. When released from farms, cities, or industry, P can contribute to water pollution problems because algal growth is limited by P in many freshwater and coastal ecosystems. Because of its essential role in agriculture, but potential as a pollutant, understanding where and how much P fertilizer is applied is important to inform management strategies that increase food security and water quality across the U.S. Information on the balance between P inputs and P uptake/removal from crops (like the 2012 data presented here) is important in order to understand potential areas where surpluses of P on cropland may be a pollution risk, while other areas may be in need of additional P to ensure high crop yields.

			The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production,  demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose>
			<supplinf>We distributed county-specific per area P input and P removal rates to agricultural lands (60 m x 60 m pixels) within the corresponding county. We capped P fertilizer application at 6,000 kg of P per km2, manure at 10,000 kg of P per km2, and crop removal at 9,000 kg of P per km2 to correct for some pixels with unrealistically high rates.</supplinf>

			<eaover>Agricultural Phosphorus Balance in 2012 was estimated by subtracting Crop Phosphorus Removal from Inorganic Phosphorus Fertilizer and Phosphorus Manure Application (P fertilizer + P manure - P crop removal EnviroAtlas layers). We acquired county-level data describing total inorganic P fertilizer, confined manure and total crop P uptake (kg P yr-1) in 2012 from IPNI (see IPNI detailed methodology for any of these two P inputs and one P output). We used the U.S. National wall-to-wall land use trends (NWALT) for 2012, acquired from the USGS, at the scale of 60 m x 60 m. These data were converted to per area rates (kg P km-2 yr-1) of crop P removal by dividing the total P input or removal by the land area (km2) of combined cultivated crop and hay/pasture (agricultural) lands within a county as determined from county-level summarization of the 2012 NWALT layer. We distributed county-specific per-area P input and P removal rates to agricultural lands (60 m x 60 m pixels) within the corresponding county. We capped P fertilizer application at 6,000 kg of P per km2, P application as manure at 10,000 kg of P per km2, and crop removal at 9,000 kg of P per km2 to correct for some pixels with unrealistically high rates. The estimates were then averaged across each 12-digit HUC and converted to kg/ha/year by dividing by 100.</eaover>
