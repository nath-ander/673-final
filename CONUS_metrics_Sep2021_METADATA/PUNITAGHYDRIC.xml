Because these data are based on SSURGO map units' percent hydric there are four thresholds used to classify if a particular map unit would be hydric. These thresholds are 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%, where a map unit area that had a value of 42% for the SSURGO hydric measurement (based on the raster dataset named "sum_comppct_r2_hydric") would be considered non-hydric under the 60% threshold but hydric under both the 20% and 40% thresholds. For this dataset, the threshold of 80% is used.

			This dataset was produced by Tetra Tech, Inc. to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract><purpose>This table allows the user to join the results of hydric soil data analyses for the total drainage area to the WBD HUC-12 GIS file for subsequent display or analysis.

			The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose><supplinf>This EnviroAtlas dataset is based on data originally developed using a version of the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD 2011) extracted for EnviroAtlas on March 22, 2011. In 2015, EnviroAtlas transitioned from the WBD 2011 to a newer version - the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) V2 WBD Snapshot, EnviroAtlas version - which includes updated 12-digit HUC boundaries for the Conterminous United States. 

			This EnviroAtlas dataset was created by reallocating the original WBD 2011 dataset to the NHDPlus V2 WBD Snapshot using area-weighted reallocation. The area weighting process assumes that values are distributed evenly across HUCs. In cases where values are unevenly distributed within a HUC, this can result in misallocated values in the new dataset. Therefore, users should exercise caution when interpreting this data, especially in regions where there are significant changes to the 12-digit HUCs. The majority of spatial changes between the two 12-digit HUC versions took place along the California coast, in Minnesota, and along the US-Canada border, especially in New England. Metric values for most of the rest of the United States are essentially unchanged. If the user is interested in data for a specific small area, especially in areas that were modified, using the original WBD 2011 version of this dataset joined with the WBD 2011 boundary feature class should provide accurate metric values. As new versions of the dataset are developed using the 2015 HUCs, these will replace the reallocated datasets in EnviroAtlas.

			Before reallocating the metrics, edits were made to the area of some 12-digit HUCs. For example, along the coast of California some 12-digit HUCs had stopped at the coastline in the WBD 2011 dataset but were extended into the ocean in the NHDPlus V2 dataset. Instead of reallocating the metrics using the total area of the NHDPlus V2 HUCs, the land area based on National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2011 was used to update the land area values. This ensured the land area of the NHDPlus V2 HUCs roughly matched the land area of the WBD 2011 HUCs. This method helped avoid incorrectly distributing terrestrial metrics, such as including the new ocean-extended area in the denominator of values that were originally calculated using land-only area as the denominator, which would result in artificially lowering the values of per-unit area metrics in the ocean-extended HUCs.</supplinf></descript><secinfo><secsys>https://project-open-data.github.io/schema/#accessLevel</secsys><secclass>public</secclass><sechandl>Standard Technical Controls</sechandl></secinfo><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development-Sustainable and Healthy Communities Research Program, EnviroAtlas</cntorg><cntper>EnviroAtlas Coordinator</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Geospatial Data Owner</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>109 T.W.

			This dataset contains data on Agricultural Land Coverage for each Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) 12-Digit Hydrological Unit Code (HUC-12) based on the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the USDA's Crop Data Layer (CDL). These combined sources provide NLCD land coverages and agricultural land uses. It can be for used for data ranging from &gt;= 80% hydric soil of "sum_comppct_r2_hydric" from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database. Percentages are calculated by raster cell counts; cell size of 30m x 30m and an area of 900 m2 per raster cell.

			A comprehensive list of metric creation steps is included in the Processing Steps.</eaover></overview></eainfo></metadata>
