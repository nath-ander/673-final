Biological N fixation (BNF) in natural/semi-natural ecosystems was estimated using a correlation with actual evapotranspiration (AET). This correlation is based on a global meta-analysis of BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland et al. 1999). AET estimates for 2006 were calculated using a regression equation describing the correlation of AET with climate (average annual daily temperature, average annual minimum daily temperature, average annual maximum daily temperature, and annual precipitation) and land use/land cover variables in the conterminous US (Sanford and Selnick 2013). Data describing annual average minimum and maximum daily temperatures and total precipitation for 2006 were acquired from the PRISM climate dataset (http://prism.oregonstate.edu). Average annual climate data were then calculated for individual 12-digit USGS Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC12s; http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html; 22 March 2011 release) using the Zonal Statistics tool in ArcMap 10.0. AET for individual HUC12s was estimated using equations described in Sanford and Selnick (2013). BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems within individual HUC12s was modeled with an equation describing the statistical relationship between BNF (kg N ha-1 yr-1) and actual evapotranspiration (AET; cm yr-1) and scaled to the proportion of non-developed and non-agricultural land in the HUC12. The first half of the equation represents the most conservative estimate in a meta-analysis of BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland et al. 1999), and was chosen over the central and high estimates because recent, top-down global mass balances that suggest that natural BNF rates are less than previous estimates based on scaled-up estimates from individual plots (Vitousek et al. 2013). The land use/land cover modifier is not included in the original Cleveland et al. (1999) analysis. We believe it is appropriate to include so as not to overestimate BNF in HUC12s with large proportions of urban or agricultural development. These data represent an average N input to individual HUC12s, i.e., they are not specific to an individual land use type within the HUC12. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract><purpose>The purpose of this data set is to provide information that can be used to estimate landscape-level loading of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in natural/semi-natural ecosystems to water resources management units, and to other management- or ecosystem-relevant spatial units. BNF is a natural supply of reactive nitrogen to ecosystems that helps sustain biological productivity, and information describing natural rates can help frame the degree to which humans have altered the loading of N to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These data can be used to examine correlations with air and water quality characteristics or be fed into terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemical models. The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose><supplinf>Citations: Cleveland, C.

			This EnviroAtlas dataset is based on data originally developed using a version of the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD 2011) extracted for EnviroAtlas on March 22, 2011. In 2015, EnviroAtlas transitioned from the WBD 2011 to a newer version - the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) V2 WBD Snapshot, EnviroAtlas version - which includes updated 12-digit HUC boundaries for the Conterminous United States. 

			This EnviroAtlas dataset was created by reallocating the original WBD 2011 dataset to the NHDPlus V2 WBD Snapshot using area-weighted reallocation. The area weighting process assumes that values are distributed evenly across HUCs. In cases where values are unevenly distributed within a HUC, this can result in misallocated values in the new dataset. Therefore, users should exercise caution when interpreting this data, especially in regions where there are significant changes to the 12-digit HUCs. The majority of spatial changes between the two 12-digit HUC versions took place along the California coast, in Minnesota, and along the US-Canada border, especially in New England. Metric values for most of the rest of the United States are essentially unchanged. If the user is interested in data for a specific small area, especially in areas that were modified, using the original WBD 2011 version of this dataset joined with the WBD 2011 boundary feature class should provide accurate metric values. As new versions of the dataset are developed using the 2015 HUCs, these will replace the reallocated datasets in EnviroAtlas.

			Before reallocating the metrics, edits were made to the area of some 12-digit HUCs. For example, along the coast of California some 12-digit HUCs had stopped at the coastline in the WBD 2011 dataset but were extended into the ocean in the NHDPlus V2 dataset. Instead of reallocating the metrics using the total area of the NHDPlus V2 HUCs, the land area based on National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2011 was used to update the land area values. This ensured the land area of the NHDPlus V2 HUCs roughly matched the land area of the WBD 2011 HUCs. This method helped avoid incorrectly distributing terrestrial metrics, such as including the new ocean-extended area in the denominator of values that were originally calculated using land-only area as the denominator, which would result in artificially lowering the values of per-unit area metrics in the ocean-extended HUCs.</supplinf></descript><secinfo><secsys>https://project-open-data.github.io/schema/#accessLevel</secsys><secclass>public</secclass><sechandl>Standard Technical Controls</sechandl></secinfo><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development-Sustainable and Healthy Communities Research Program, EnviroAtlas</cntorg><cntper>EnviroAtlas Coordinator</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Geospatial Data Owner</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>109 T.W.

A comprehensive list of metric creation steps is included in the Processing Steps. 

			Biological N fixation (BNF) in natural/semi-natural ecosystems was estimated using a correlation with
			actual evapotranspiration (AET). This correlation is based on a global meta-analysis of BNF in
			natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland et al. 1999).
			AET estimates for 2006 were calculated using a regression equation describing the correlation
			of AET with climate and land use/land cover variables in the conterminous US (Sanford and Selnick
			2013). Data describing annual average minimum and maximum daily temperatures and total
			precipitation at the 2.5 arcmin (~4 km) scale for 2006 were acquired from the PRISM climate dataset
			(http://prism.oregonstate.edu). The AET regression equation requires annual average daily temperature;
			we thus calculated annual average temperature as the mean value of the minimum and maximum
			temperature on a cell-by-cell basis using the Zonal Statistics tool in ArcMap 10.0 (ESRI, Inc. Redlands,
			CA). Average annual daily temperature, average annual minimum daily temperature, average annual
			maximum daily temperature, and annual precipitation were then calculated for individual 12-digit USGS
			Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC12s; http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html; 22 March 2011 release) using
			the Zonal Statistics tool in ArcMap 10.0.
			The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) for 2006 were acquired from the USGS at the
			scale of 30 x 30 m (http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd06_data.php). Percent covers of developed lands (d; low
			+ medium + high intensities), agricultural land (a; cultivated crops + hay/pasture), forest (f; conifer +
			deciduous + mixed), shrubland (s; dwarf + shrub/scrub), grassland/herbaceous, and wetland (w; woody
			+ emergent herbaceous) were calculated for individual HUC12s using the Zonal Statistics tool in
			ArcMap 10.0.
			AET for individual HUC12s was estimated with the following equations (Sanford and Selnick
			2013):
			(1) AET = PΛ(τ∆/(τ∆+Π))
			(2) Λ=1+cLd+eLf+hLs+jLg+kLa+rLw
			(3) τ = ((Tm+T0)^m)/(((Tm+T0)^m)+a)
			(4) ∆=(Tx-Tn)/((Tx-Tn)+b)
			(5) Π=(P/P0)^n
			Where P is annual precipitation (cm yr-1), Tm is mean annual daily temperature ( ℃), Tx is mean annual
			minimum daily temperature ( ℃), Tn is mean annual maximum daily temperature ( ℃), and Li is the
			fraction of land cover type i within an individual HUC12. The remaining fixed parameter values for
			equations 2 - 5 are listed in Table 1.
			BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems within individual HUC12s was modeled with an
			equation describing the statistical relationship between BNF (kg N ha-1 yr-1) and actual
			evapotranspiration (AET; cm yr-1) and scaled to the proportion of non-developed and non-agricultural
			land in the HUC12:
			(6) BNF = (0.102 * AET + 0.524)*(1-(Ld+La)).
			The first half of the equation represents the most conservative estimate in a meta-analysis of BNF in
			natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland et al. 1999), and was chosen over the central and high
			estimates because recent, top-down global mass balances that suggest that natural BNF rates are less
			than previous estimates based on scaled-up estimates from individual plots (Vitousek et al. 2013). The
			land use/land cover modifier is not included in the original Cleveland et al. (1999) analysis. We believe
			it is appropriate to include so as not to overestimate BNF in HUC12s with large proportions of urban
			or agricultural development.
