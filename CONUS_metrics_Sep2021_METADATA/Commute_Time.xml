Data were compiled from the Census ACS (American Community Survey) 5-year Summary Data. The commute time is the amount of travel time in minutes for workers to get from home to work. This value includes private vehicle use, carpooling, public transit, bicycling, or walking. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract><purpose>This dataset presents the patterns of commute time of working populations. Commute time is a measure of the efficiency of a transportation system and is often influenced by community development patterns, labor market shifts, and technological changes that expand workers' options for where and how to work (ACS, 2011). A high commute time can signify a sprawled region and/or a lack of efficient transit, while a low commute time implies a dense region and/or an efficient transit system. Long commute time contributes to increased air pollution as cars, buses, or trains emit pollutants while moving and sitting idle in traffic, while a short commute time contributes to lower emissions. Commute time has also been shown to affect human health and social relationships. Growing evidence supports the association between vehicle travel time and stress (Frumkin, 2002), obesity (Frank et al., 2004; Lopez-Zetina et al., 2006; Inagami et al., 2006), and diabetes (Pasala et al., 2010). Additionally, long automobile commuting duration could affect quality of life by reducing the amount of time spent with family and friends (Christian, 2012). The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose></descript><spdom><bounding><westbc>-128.02839229</westbc><eastbc>-65.20336449</eastbc><northbc>51.6773602</northbc><southbc>22.7348894</southbc></bounding></spdom><secinfo><secsys>https://project-open-data.github.io/schema/#accessLevel</secsys><secclass>public</secclass><sechandl>Standard Technical Controls</sechandl></secinfo><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development-Sustainable and Healthy Communities Research Program, EnviroAtlas</cntorg><cntper>EnviroAtlas Coordinator</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Geospatial Data Owner</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>109 T.W.

This dataset portrays the commute time of workers to their workplace for each Census Block Group (CBG) during 2008-2012. Data were compiled from the Census ACS (American Community Survey) 5-year Summary Data. The commute time is the amount of travel time in minutes for workers to get from home to work. This value includes private vehicle use, carpooling, public transit, bicycling, or walking.

ACS obtained the data through survey questions related to travel; these questions focus solely on commuting and do not ask about leisure travel or other non-work trips. This dataset includes commuting characteristics for workers 16 years and over who were employed during the week prior to the ACS reference week and did not work at home. Persons on vacation or not at work the prior week are not included. Respondents answer questions about where they work, what time they leave home for work, the means of transportation used to get there, the number of workers riding in a car, truck, or van, and how long it takes to travel to work. 

A comprehensive list of metric creation steps is included in the Processing Steps. The processing scripts were completed using Python scripts.
