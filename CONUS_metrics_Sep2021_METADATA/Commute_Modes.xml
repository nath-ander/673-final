Data were compiled from the Census ACS (American Community Survey) 5-year Summary Data. The commute modes are the travel methods workers use to get from home to work.  The commute modes mapped include private vehicle use (drive alone or carpooling), public transit, bicycling, and walking. Workers who work from home were also reported. 

			This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract><purpose>In recent decades, car-oriented commuting has generated a number of environmental and mobility problems worldwide, which highlight the need to develop and encourage more environmentally sustainable modes of transportation. Although bicycling and walking make up a relatively small portion of commuting activity in the United States, these non-motorized travel modes might play important roles within many of the nation's local transportation systems (ACS, 2014). The promotion of non-motorized modes of transport, like bicycles and walking, is increasingly being recognized as an effective way of addressing these urban transport and related public health problems (Rietveld and Daniel, 2004). In particular, a shift from car to bicycle could reduce road congestion and traffic-related air pollution since cycling has low space requirements and is a non-polluting transport mode (Chapman, 2007; Beckx et al., 2009). It also reduces noise, vibration, road accidents, infrastructure costs (e.g. less road maintenance) as well as the dependence of the economy upon fossil fuels. Furthermore, cycling is a cheap way of being physically active and preventing the health risks of a sedentary lifestyle (Pucher et al., 1999; WHO, 2002; de Geus, 2007). Therefore, understanding the current transport patterns and encouraging more sustainable transportation systems are very important for community development and human health. 

			This data layer presents the modes of travel to work for workers as well as the population who work from home. This information could support evaluating the sustainability and health of communities, especially the communities' transport system. It could also be used to guide future improvements to community transportation.

			The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose></descript><secinfo><secsys>https://project-open-data.github.io/schema/#accessLevel</secsys><secclass>public</secclass><sechandl>Standard Technical Controls</sechandl></secinfo><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development-Sustainable and Healthy Communities Research Program, EnviroAtlas</cntorg><cntper>EnviroAtlas Coordinator</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Geospatial Data Owner</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>109 T.W.

transportation to work, including working from home, within each Census Block Group (CBG) during 2008-2012. 

			Data were compiled from the Census American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Summary Data. The commute modes are the travel methods workers use to get from home to work. The commute modes mapped include private vehicle use (drive alone or carpooling), public transit, bicycling, and walking. Workers who work from home were also reported.

			The list below shows which columns from Table B08301 were included in each metric:
			*Drive: Car, truck, or van: Drove alone,  In 2-person carpool, in 3-person carpool, in 4-person carpool, in 5- or 6-person carpool, in 7-or-more-person carpool (columns 158 to 165).

			*Public: Public transportation: Bus or trolley bus, Streetcar or trolley car, Subway or elevated, Railroad, Ferryboat (columns 166 to 171).

			*Bicycle: Bicycle: Bicycle (column 174).

			*Walk: Walk: Walk (column 175).

			*Home: Work at home: work at home (columns 166 to 171).

			*Other: Other means: Taxicab, Motorcycle, Other means (columns 172, 173, and 176).

			*DriveAlone: Car, truck, or van: Drove alone

			*Carpool: Car, truck, or van: In 2-person carpool, in 3-person carpool, in 4-person carpool, in 5- or 6-person carpool, in 7-or-more-person carpool.

			*BikeWalk: Walk: Walk (column 175),  *Bicycle: Bicycle (column 174).

			The percentages of workers using a specific travel mean is obtained by dividing the number of the workers in that category by the population of total workers (column 157).
