			<abstract>This EnviroAtlas dataset portrays the percentage of population within different household income ranges for each Census Block Group (CBG), a threshold estimated to be an optimal household income for emotional well-being, and the percentage of households with income below this threshold. Data were compiled from the Census ACS (American Community Survey) 5-year Summary Data (2008-2012).

This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract>
			<purpose>This information can be used to evaluate the household economy and the related emotional well-being for Census Block Groups. 

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) indicated that while money may not buy happiness, it is an important means to achieve higher living standards and thus greater well-being (OECD, 2012). Higher economic wealth may also improve access to quality education, health care and housing; income therefore influences people's mental and physical health (Zahran, 2005). While most research has focused on how income affects psychological well-being, De Neve and Oswald (2012) explored reverse causality and found that happier individuals are more likely to perform better financially.

Household income has been found to be closely related to human well-being, which makes it an important factor in evaluating quality of life. Household income distribution presented in this data layer was calculated based on Census American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Summary Data (2008-2012). It is based on the income groups originally provided in the Census ACS. To better present the how income might impact quality of life, we further classify the income into groups: below twice the poverty line ($30,000), above twice the poverty line and below $75,000, above $75,000 and below $200,000, and above $200,000. These groups focus on the relatively wealthy/middle class group and are a companion to the EnviroAtlas layers "Population with income below twice the poverty level" and "Percent population with income below twice the poverty level." The classification was based on publicly recognized studies focusing on the United States. Census and Beeghley (2004) suggested that the "rich" refers to household income in the top 5% of the nation, corresponding to an annual income of above $200,000. 
Kahneman and Deaton (2010) found that life evaluation (the thoughts that people have about their life) and emotional well-being increase steadily with household income, but the increase in emotional well-being stopped when the annual household income reached $75,000. $75,000 was considered to represent the national average of the optimal household income for quality of life. A recent study suggested that the happiness threshold would be more appropriate if adjusted to the local cost of living, which takes into consideration the huge variation in cost of living across the nation (Short, 2014). Based on this research, we adjusted the $75,000 quality of life threshold using a county-level cost of living index, which was developed by the Council for Community and Economic Research (C2ER).  Then we calculated the percentage of the households whose annual household income is below the adjusted threshold. 

The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose>

				<procdesc>6. Calculated the percentage of households in each block group that was below the adjusted threshold for quality of life (adjusted_QOL_threshold). See the overview section of the metadata for a list of the original ACS income range categories that were used to calculate this metric. For each CBG, if the adjusted threshold was between $60,000 - $74,999, then the under threshold groups include categories 1 to 10. If the adjusted threshold was between $75,000 - $99,999, then the under threshold groups include categories 1 to 11. If the adjusted threshold was between $100,000 - $125,000, the under threshold groups include categories 1 to 12. If the adjusted threshold was between $125,000 - 150,000, the under threshold groups include categories 1 to 13. Finally, the index information was joined to the attribute table of the community shapefile using CBG code as the join key.</procdesc>
