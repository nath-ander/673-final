The metrics included in this data set identify total rare acres and the protected rare acres within each 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC).  The percentage of the terrestrial area of each HUC covered by rare ecosystems as well as the percent of rare acres that are protected are also included.  This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract><purpose>Conservation of biodiversity remains a high priority for maintaining many ecosystem functions, and conservation efforts often focus on protecting vulnerable species. Species population measurements may not be suitable for evaluating the collective benefits and services that emerge from entire ecosystems, particularly those that do not contain rare or charismatic species.  Here we combine currently available land cover data with ecosystem taxonomy and landscape ecology principles to evaluate the relative rarity of natural ecosystems in the continental US.  Our goal was to develop a measure of ecosystem rarity that can distinguish ecosystems with intrinsically limited extents consistent with historic conditions (i.e. riparian or bog systems) from those that have limited area due to land conversion. We present a relative rarity metric that ranks ecosystems based on current extent, spatial pattern type, and relative uniqueness.  This metric shows promise when compared to more complex and expensive methods. The majority (57%) of the area covered by 'rare' ecosystems we identify in the continental US fall within the boundaries of the Nature Conservancy's Conservation Priority Areas, whereas only 28% of our 'rare' ecosystems are currently held in protected status.  The ecosystem rarity index we developed captures both fine scale species diversity as well as regional ecosystem services.  This type of metric can support efforts such as creating an ecosystem Red List. The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose></descript><secinfo><secsys>https://project-open-data.github.io/schema/#accessLevel</secsys><secclass>public</secclass><sechandl>Standard Technical Controls</sechandl></secinfo><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development-Sustainable and Healthy Communities Research Program, EnviroAtlas</cntorg><cntper>EnviroAtlas Coordinator</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Geospatial Data Owner</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>109 T.W.

1.	The USGS GAP Analysis landcover data (Version 2, 2011) was used to identify the natural terrestrial ecosystems of the United States.  This means that landcover types relating to open water and human use ( i.e. urban, agriculture, or plantation forests) were removed from the landcover data set.

2.	These natural ecosystems were then grouped into their corresponding spatial pattern category, of which there are four.  These four patterns are each defined by set criteria and include a discussion of disturbance regimes and are derived from the work of Comer et al. 2003.  Small patch forming systems are defined as those that form small, discrete areas of vegetation cover typically limited in distribution by localized environmental features.  In undisturbed conditions, typical occurrences range from 1-50 ha (2.47 - 123.5 acres). Large patch forming systems are defined as systems that form large areas of interrupted cover and typically have narrower ranges of ecological tolerances than matrix types.  Individual disturbance events tend to occupy patches that can encompass a large proportion of the overall occurrence (e.g. &gt;20%). In undisturbed conditions, typical occurrences range from 50-2,000 ha (123.5 - 4940 acres). Matrix forming systems are defined as those that form extensive and contiguous cover, occur on the most extensive landforms, and typically have wide ecological tolerances.  Disturbance patches typically occupy a relatively small percentage (e.g. &lt;5%) of the total occurrence. In undisturbed conditions, typical occurrences range in size from 2,000 to 100,000 ha (4940 - 247,000 acres). Linear systems are defined as systems that occur as linear strips and are often ecotonal between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In undisturbed conditions, typical occurrences range in linear distance from 0.5 to 100 km (0.31 - 62 miles).
3.	Within the four spatial pattern categories, the ecosystems were aggregated up a taxonomic level (within the National vegetation Classification (NVC) hierarchy) to the macrogroup. The NVC macrogroups are defined as subcontinental or regional communities differing by mesoclimate, geology, substrate, hydrology, and disturbance regimes (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2009).  Many of the ecosystems in the GAP Version 2 dataset are similar to one another.  This raised the question of whether or not the ecosystem unit was the correct scale to consider for the conservation of biodiversity.  For example, there are six ecosystems with titles that begin with "Southern Coastal Plain Nonriverine Basin Swamp".  Each of these six systems has a unique modifier associated, such as "Okefenokee Bay/Gum Modifier" or "Okefenokee Pine Modifier;" yet these six systems seem comparable enough to act as habitat substitutes for one another. To deal with the potential niche overlap of the individual ecosystems we aggregated up a level in the NVC hierarchy to the macrogroup level. Aggregating the ecosystems into macrogroups assures adequate variability in species assemblages, both plant and animal, between ecological communities considered in calculating the rarity metric. 
4.	We have first sorted the ecosystems into their corresponding spatial patterns in order to rank relative rarity amongst comparable systems. Next, we aggregated the systems within each spatial pattern type up to the macrogroup level to reduce habitat niche overlap that may exist at the finer ecosystem scale.  This sorting of ecosystems by spatial pattern category followed by aggregation to the macrogroup level created a unique set of ecological entities that could not be referred to as either ecosystems or macrogroups.  We refer to this unique set as ecoforms, of which there are 199.  We ranked each of the four spatial pattern sets of ecoforms by descending area (i.e. the ecoform with the greatest area is ranked as 1, then the ecoform with the second greatest area is ranked as 2 etc...). We then divided this rank by the total number of ecoforms in each spatial pattern set. This ratio was then normalized by multiplying by 100 and rounding to the nearest integer. This gives us an index of rarity ranging from 0 (common) to 100 (rare).
5.	A threshold value of 75 was selected; thus defining ecoforms (and corresponding ecosystems) with index values &gt; 75 as rare.
6.	The GAP Version 2 landcover raster was reclassified to a binary raster indicating whether or not a given pixel of landcover met the definition for rarity or not.  
7.	This binary raster was then summarized to the 12-digit HUCs using zonal statistics to give the total rare acres. 
8.	The rarity rankings were then compared with the Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) 1.2 to determine how much of the ecosystem area designated as rare by our analysis is currently afforded a high level of protection.  PADUS 1.2 is a national database of protected lands published by the USGS GAP Analysis Program (GAP 2011b).  PADUS 1.2 has categorized the level of protection for each area included within the database into four levels.  Status code 1 is defined as an area with permanent protection from any resource use that results in land cover change along with a management plan designed to mimic natural disturbance regimes; this level equates with IUCN Protected area categories Ia, Ib, and II.  Status code 2 is defined as an area with permanent protection and a management plan that allows selective use of resources; this level equates with IUCN Protected Area categories III, IV, V, and VI.  These two highest levels of protection in the GAP protected Status (codes 1 and 2) were selected to consider the protected status of rare ecosystems. The binary raster of ecosystem rarity (output of step 6 above) was extracted using the limited PADUS 1.2 polygon data (only GAP codes 1 and 2) as a mask.  The output was a raster of protected rare pixels.  This raster was then summarized to the 12-digit HUCs using zonal statistics to give the total rare protected acres. If a given HUC contained no rare pixels at all, then the value for this field is null.
9.	The GAP Version 2  landcover data was used to calculate the total terrestrial area of the 12-digit HUCs.  The landcover raster was reclassified to remove all open water landcover types.  This terrestrial-only version of the landcover was then summarized to the 12-digit HUCs using zonal statistics to give the total terrestrial area.
10.	The percent of the HUC that is rare was calculated by dividing the total rare acres (output of step 7) by the total terrestrial acres (output of step 9) and multiplying by 100.  There are no null values for this field.
11.	The percent of the rare area protected within a HUC was calculated by dividing the total protected rare acres by the total rare acres. If a given HUC contained no rare pixels at all, then the value for this field is null.
