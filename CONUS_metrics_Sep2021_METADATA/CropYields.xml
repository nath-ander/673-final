The values are based on data from the United States Department of Agriculture's 2010 Cropland Data Layer (CDL). 

			This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract><purpose>This data can be used to find estimates of the amount and variety of fruits and vegetables grown in each 12-digit HUC. This information can provide insight into differences in access to locally grown produce across the United States. Users can visualize where in the US fruits and vegetables are most heavily produced, or find out how many different kinds of fruits or vegetables are grown near them. The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose><supplinf>Yield data was not available for every crop. Therefore, some crops that were counted toward fruit or vegetable crop area were not counted towards yields. This results in some 12-digit HUCs that show area used for growing fruits or vegetables, but either have no yields or low yields. The information in this dataset is an estimate based on the best available data, and should not be seen as a precise count or measurement of all crops in a HUC12.

			This EnviroAtlas dataset is based on data originally developed using a version of the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD 2011) extracted for EnviroAtlas on March 22, 2011. In 2015, EnviroAtlas transitioned from the WBD 2011 to a newer version - the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) V2 WBD Snapshot, EnviroAtlas version - which includes updated 12-digit HUC boundaries for the Conterminous United States. 

			This EnviroAtlas dataset was created by reallocating the original WBD 2011 dataset to the NHDPlus V2 WBD Snapshot using area-weighted reallocation. The area weighting process assumes that values are distributed evenly across HUCs. In cases where values are unevenly distributed within a HUC, this can result in misallocated values in the new dataset. Therefore, users should exercise caution when interpreting this data, especially in regions where there are significant changes to the 12-digit HUCs. The majority of spatial changes between the two 12-digit HUC versions took place along the California coast, in Minnesota, and along the US-Canada border, especially in New England. Metric values for most of the rest of the United States are essentially unchanged. If the user is interested in data for a specific small area, especially in areas that were modified, using the original WBD 2011 version of this dataset joined with the WBD 2011 boundary feature class should provide accurate metric values. As new versions of the dataset are developed using the 2015 HUCs, these will replace the reallocated datasets in EnviroAtlas.

			Before reallocating the metrics, edits were made to the area of some 12-digit HUCs. For example, along the coast of California some 12-digit HUCs had stopped at the coastline in the WBD 2011 dataset but were extended into the ocean in the NHDPlus V2 dataset. Instead of reallocating the metrics using the total area of the NHDPlus V2 HUCs, the land area based on National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2011 was used to update the land area values. This ensured the land area of the NHDPlus V2 HUCs roughly matched the land area of the WBD 2011 HUCs. This method helped avoid incorrectly distributing terrestrial metrics, such as including the new ocean-extended area in the denominator of values that were originally calculated using land-only area as the denominator, which would result in artificially lowering the values of per-unit area metrics in the ocean-extended HUCs.</supplinf></descript><secinfo><secsys>https://project-open-data.github.io/schema/#accessLevel</secsys><secclass>public</secclass><sechandl>Standard Technical Controls</sechandl></secinfo><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development-Sustainable and Healthy Communities Research Program, EnviroAtlas</cntorg><cntper>EnviroAtlas Coordinator</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Geospatial Data Owner</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>109 T.W.

			Crops were categorized as fruits, vegetables, or nuts.
			Crops such as tomatoes were classified as vegetables based on their use.
			In the case of double crops: 
			- lettuce/durum wheat, lettuce/cotton, and lettuce/barley were categorized as vegetables.
			- lettuce/cantaloupe was counted twice; it was added to both the fruit and vegetable count. 
			Crops were categorized as follows: 
			Fruits: Watermelons, Cherries, Peaches, Apples, Grapes, Citrus, Pears, Cantaloupes, Prunes, Oranges, Honeydew Melons, Pomegranates, Nectarines, Plums, Strawberries, Apricots, Blueberries, Cranberries.
			Vegetables: Sweet Corn, Mint, Sugarbeets, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes, Onions, Cucumbers, Peas, Tomatoes, Hops, Herbs, Carrots, Asparagus, Garlic, Olives, Broccoli, Peppers, Squash, Lettuce, Pumpkins, Double Crop Lettuce/Durum Wheat, Double Crop Lettuce/Cotton, Double Crop Lettuce/Barley, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Celery, Radishes, Eggplants.
			Nuts: Almonds, Pistachios. Nuts did not appear often in the data, and they are not included in the final metrics.

			Double Crop Lettuce/Cantaloupe was counted twice, once as a fruit and once as a vegetable. 

			Fruit and vegetable areas are the sums of the areas for all fruit or vegetable crops in each HUC12 in hectares.

			Yields are in tons. 

			Yield data was not available for every crop. Therefore, some crops that were counted toward fruit or vegetable crop area were not counted towards yields. This results in some 12-digit HUCs that show area used for growing fruits or vegetables, but either have no yields or low yields. The information in this dataset is an estimate based on the best available data, and should not be seen as a precise count or measurement of all crops in a HUC12.</eaover></overview></eainfo></metadata>
